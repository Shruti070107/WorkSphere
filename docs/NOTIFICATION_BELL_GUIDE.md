# NotificationBell Component Guide

The `NotificationBell` component displays user notifications in the application's top navigation bar. It retrieves notification data from the backend, displays unread counts, and allows users to mark notifications as read.

---

## Component Location

```
src/components/NotificationBell.tsx
```

---

## Props

The component currently does **not** accept any props.

```tsx
import { NotificationBell } from "@/components/NotificationBell";

export default function TopNavigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <NotificationBell />
    </nav>
  );
}
```

## Features

- Displays unread notification badge.
- Shows the latest 20 notifications.
- Automatically refreshes notifications.
- Marks notifications as read.
- Closes when clicking outside.
- Displays contextual icons for different notification types.
- Links directly to related workspaces when available.

---

## Polling

The component fetches notifications immediately after mounting.

It then refreshes notifications every **20 seconds**.

```ts
setInterval(fetchNotifications, 20000);
```

The polling interval is automatically cleared when the component unmounts.
